# On demand, publishes the provided release version to GitHub Release.
#
# Maintainers' post-activities:
# 1. the RELEASE BRANCH is automatically created to include release preparation commits: verify and
#    merge it to `main`, and finally discard it.
# 2. the GITHUB RELEASE is created as draft: verify and publish it.
#
# NOTE: No release component is published, as this project is internal.
