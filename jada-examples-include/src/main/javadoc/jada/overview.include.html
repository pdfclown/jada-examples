      Such inclusion is also an interesting demonstration of <b>hierarchical resource selection</b>.
      The resource directories are configured via {@code --jada-dir} option, prioritized according
      to their inverse order of definition (that is, the last one has the highest priority) — this
      behavior is useful to override a resource with a more specific one of the same name. In this
      example, we defined two resource directories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>{@code jada-examples/src/main/javadoc/jada}</li>
      <li>{@code jada-examples/jada-examples-include/src/main/javadoc/jada}</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Because of the above-mentioned ordering, subproject-specific {@code
      "jada-examples/jada-examples-include/.../jada"} wins over common {@code
      "jada-examples/.../jada"}; as a result, now you are reading the content of {@code
      "jada-examples/jada-examples-include/.../jada/overview.include.html"} instead of {@code
      "jada-examples/.../jada/overview.include.html"}, whilst they both correspond to the same
      resource name ({@code "overview.include.html"}). If you change the name of the former file and
      regenerate Javadoc ({@code ./mvnw clean javadoc:javadoc}), you will see that the latter
      (previously overridden because of its lower priority) is rendered instead!
